# Multi QA RAG Chatbot: LangChain + OpenAI + FAISS + Streamlit

## Overview

This project is an advanced PDF Question-Answering (QA) chatbot that allows users to chat with their PDF documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It leverages:
- **LangChain** for RAG pipeline
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** for conversational answers
- **FAISS** for fast vector search
- **Streamlit** for a modern, interactive chat UI

Users can upload a PDF, ask multiple questions in a conversational chat format, and receive context-aware answers grounded in the document.

## Features

- **Sidebar for API Key & PDF Upload:** Clean separation of setup and chat.
- **Conversational Chat UI:** Multi-turn chat with persistent message history.
- **Streaming Answers:** See the assistant's answer as it is generated (real-time streaming).
- **PDF Chunking & Semantic Search:** Automatic chunking and vector search for relevant context.
- **OpenAI-Powered:** Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for high-quality, concise answers.
- **Session State:** Remembers chat history and loaded knowledge base.

## How It Works

1. **User enters OpenAI API key and uploads a PDF in the sidebar.**
2. The app loads and splits the PDF into text chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded and indexed in a FAISS vector store.
4. User asks questions in the chat interface.
5. The app retrieves relevant context and streams the answer from GPT-3.5-turbo.
6. All chat history is displayed in a conversational format.
